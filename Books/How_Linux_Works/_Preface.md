## Preface

#### p.xix

"...I believe you should be able to learn what your computer does. You should be able to make your software do what you want it to do... The key to attaining this power lies in understanding the fundamentals of what the software does and how it works.."

Linux doesn't try and hide anything from the user; most config files can be found as plaintext files.
