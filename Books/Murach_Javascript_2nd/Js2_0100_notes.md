## How a Web Application Works

*A web applicaton consists of many components that work together as they bring the application to a computer or mobile device*

A web application consists of *clients*, technological consumers of applications, and a *server*, which holds the files the clients access, and a *network*, which connects the two devices.

A *static* web page doesn't change every time it's requested and usually is one that ends in .htm or .html

A *dynamic* web page is generated by a program or script running on a server.

Dynamic web pages can involve several scripts, programs, applications, databases, servers, etc. depending on complexity

The activity that happens on the server side, as opposed to the client side, is known as *server-side processing*

The process that begins with the user requesting a web page and ends with the server sending a response back to the client is called a *round trip*

*Javascript* is a *scripting language* that provides for *client-side processing*

Some uses of Javascript/Jquery:
  * Data Validation
  * Image swaps and rollovers
  * Slide shows

Javascript is run by a *Javascript engine* that is part of a browser

Javascript was invented by NetScape in 1995 and released initially as part of their browser, Navigator, in 1996

Javascript standards are known as the *ECMAScript specification*, the latest released was *ECMAScript 6*, released in June 2015

Some important additions in ECMA5:
  * Strict mode
  * Array methods
  * Better object creation/handling
  * Built-in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
  
[ECMAScript 6 Specification](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html)

When Javascript changes the HTML for a page, it is called *DOM scripting*

DOM == *Document Object Model*

Javascript commonly uses HTML *attributes* to refer to HMTL elements

The *id* and *class* attributes are usually only used to apply CSS formatting

The *name* attribute is commonly used by server-side code to access the data that is sent to it or by Javascript code to select specific elements

The *for* attribute in a label element is used to identify the control it applies to

The *title* attribute specifies additional information about an element
