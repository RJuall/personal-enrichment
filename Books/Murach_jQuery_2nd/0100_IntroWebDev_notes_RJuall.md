## How a Web Application Works

*A web application consists of many components that work together as they bring the application to your computer or mobile device.*

Web applications consisto of *clients* and a *web server*

Clients include computers, tablets, mobile devices - access web pages through *web browsers*

The web server holds the files that make up a web application

A *network* is a system that allows clients and servers to communicate.

The *Internet* is a large network that consists of many smaller networks - represented by the *cloud*

A *local area network (LAN)* is a small network of computers that are near each other and can communicate with each other over short distances

LAN is often called an *intranet* - used to run web applications for use by a certain group (company, etc.)

A *wide area network (WAN)* consists of multiple LANs that have been connected

An *Internet service provider (ISP)* is a company that owns a WAN that is connected to the Internet

A *static web page* is a web page that doesn't change each time it's requested - extension .htm or .html

A *HTTP Request* formatted using *HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)* is one way that browsers and servers communicate and transfer files

*HyperText Markup Language (HTML)* a language used to format, organize, provide context to web pages

The browser *renders* - translates - the HTML/CSS/JS/etc. into a web page displayed on the browser

A *dynamic web page* is created by a program or script on the server whenever it's requested - the server processing those requests is an *application server*

A *database server* holds and serves a database used by an application or web server

The process beginning with a user requesting a web page and ending with the server sending a response is known as a *round trip*

*Javascript* is a *scripting language* run by the *Javascript engine* or a web browser

Similar to HTML/CSS, Javascript is loaded into the browser when found

Normally Javascript is run by the client machine and does not require trips to and from the server, adding to efficiency

*jQuery* is a Javascript library that provides various functionality

## The Components of a Javascript Application

*HTML defines content, CSS formats, Javascript does client-side processing*

CSS and Javascript must be coded into or linked into HTML in order for it to be utilized by the browser

*elements* or *tags* describe one unit of HTML code, as in <p></p>, etc

When Javascript changes the HTML for a page it is known as *DOM Scripting*
